# My Tube

### Copy of the most popular video platform.

##### To create this, I used: folder and file structure, hooks, refs, and React Context API. In this set up, I put a search engine which helps the user to find what they are looking for. This particular search engine connects key words with videos, and these can be played in reduced-screen mode or in full screen.This automatically reaches to five other videos, stemming from one phrase.
